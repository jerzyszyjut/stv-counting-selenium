# stv-counting-selenium
Script made for RP server purposes, it counts votes from STV elections. To ensure every player that votes are counted correctly we used third-party site and used this bot to input data as manual input was very problematic with hundreds of votes and tens of candidates. It loads votes from .csv file downloaded from Google Forms, parses them and inputs into chosen website.
